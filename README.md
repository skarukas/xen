# xen
xen is a high-level, interpreted language for analyzing and operating upon 
musical pitch structures within the context of "xenharmonic" microtonal theory. The interpreter is written in ES6 JavaScript and based off ["AEL"](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/345888/How-to-Write-a-Simple-Interpreter-in-JavaScript) by Peter Olson. xen is heavily reliant on [tune.js](https://github.com/skarukas/tune), a library which models the xen data types as classes in JavaScript/TypeScript. 

## Console
The online [xen console](https://skarukas.github.io/xen/) includes the interpreter and can be used to evaluate expressions, like a sort of xenharmonic calculator.
